# User Story (MVP)

GIVEN a news website with form inputs
WHEN I arrive at the website
THEN I am presented with a header with the current date and time, a news search form, a reddit search form, the news section with a carousel displaying 10 default news stories, a reddit section with default reddit posts.
WHEN I enter a category into the news form
THEN the category is displayed in the news section carousel and the text is changed to the user-input category. Each card in the carousel will include an image, title, description and link to the news article.
WHEN I enter a key word search in the reddit form
THEN the form autocompletes my search and fills the reddit portion with reddit articles related to the searched word


## Extra

ADD for fun section with crossword/sudoku?
ADD another tech (trianglify?) to use for background imaging
